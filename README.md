Name: Jordan Woodard

Overview: This is a school project for a task manager web app.  Basically, the theme of the project involves robotics and cybertechnology, with the idea being that the app is being monitored by a robot named "Taskbot", whose programming function is to help humans complete their tasks by reminding them of what need to be done.

Details: Taskbot uses the React library for adding and deleting todo list tasks. The app features three sections: Home, Task List, and Contact Form. .  Some other parts of the page can also be clicked on, which leads to an alert message.  This happens when clicking on the navigation bar, the todo list form, and the contact form.

Technologies: html, css, js, jsx
