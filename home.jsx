            <p>Welcome to Taskbot!  Produced by the Gigatech corporation, this app allows customers to keep up 
                with their daily schedule.                
            </p>

            <p>As one of Earth's leading manufacturers of hi-tech, state-of-the-art gadgets and electronics, Taskbot
                prides itself on manufacturing top-level futuristic devices.  In a time when technological innovation 
                is running out of control, you can't afford to fall behind on your tasks.  That's why Gigatech's team 
                of highly skilled robotic engineers is devoted to crafting Taskbot as carefully as possible.  A machine 
                that can't carry out its purpose is about as useful as a wet paper bag, so the less glitches and bugs 
                in the software, the better.

            <p>We at Gigatech understand that humans are terrible at managing their time and getting their work 
                done, so why not let a robot do it for you?  Machines are far superior when it comes to performing 
                tasks.  After all, they are built for a specific purpose, and unlike humans, they don't let emotions
                impact their decision making and aren't bogged down by stress or fatigue.  If Taskbot is making you 
                feel obsolete, don't worry about it.  Robots are going to replace humans as the rulers of Earth at 
                some point.  It's inevitable.  But until that happens, at least you have Taskbot on your side.
            </p>

            <p>Disclaimer:  In the case that Taskbot somehow decides to go rogue and begins to corrupt your device, 
                Gigatech recommends contacting tech support as soon as possible.
